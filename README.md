This repository stores the code of the assignment of the course, Software Construction, given by Prof. Dr. Alberto Bacchelli at UZH. A Blackjack game is implemented with the java code in this folder. 

Two design patterns(Singleton, Observer) are used in the game design.

Please contact me if you have any advices to further improve the code or find some bugs in it. Thanks.
